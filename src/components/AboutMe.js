            Hi, my name is Jean Gregor Fonrose. I am currently a student at the
            University of Florida pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science. I
            am a driven student leveraging studies in Computer Science and
            seeking real-world experience as an intern. I will be dedicated to
            meeting company goals by being consistent, following practices,
            bringing innovation, and solving problems. I adapt easily to new
            situations and challenges.
